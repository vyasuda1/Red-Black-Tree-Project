	This project features two main classes: RBTTester.java and RedBlackTree.java. We implemented a dictionary using
    a red black tree as our container, which has different methods that can insert nodes, search for nodes, and fix 
    the tree.
	
	JUnit 4 will be required to run the RBTTester.java class. This class has JUnit tests for testing the dictionary,
    the different methods in the RedBlackTree class, and obtaining the run time (in ms).
